  "description": "Simple OAuth2 client for Unity. Based on the authentication-unity repository from https://github.com/cdmvision/authentication-unity, this package has been modified to provide better integration with multiple types of OAuth2 providers, including Azure Entra ID, and a multi-redirect system depending on which platform you are running it on. WebGL is a work in progress, but it is one of the main objectives of this package.",
